# Expensive-Tracker-in-Python
This Python script tracks expenses by allowing users to add, view, and search transactions by date. It uses a simple menu system for user interaction and stores data in a dictionary. For GitHub, consider adding comments, improving input validation, and organizing the code into functions for clarity.
